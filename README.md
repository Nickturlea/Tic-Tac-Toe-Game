# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

This mini game consists of a basic Tic-Tac-Toe two player game, one person clicks to start off with X and alternate turns clicking on the boxes they assign, getting 3 in a row displays a win message and then prompts to restart game and play again. Its a simple yet fun to play two plyer game on one console.
