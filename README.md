# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

This mini-game consists of a basic Tic-Tac-Toe two-player game, one person clicks to start with X then O and alternate turns clicking on the boxes they assign, getting 3 in a row displays a win message and then prompts to restart the game and play again. It's simple yet fun to play two-player games on one console.
